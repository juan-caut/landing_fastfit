            <p>The company was born when the corresponding need for sexual harassment or bullying towards women by
                people who are not aware of the damage they do was found. For this reason, our goal is to provide
                effective solutions to users who seek specialized psychological support through their mobile
                applications, managing to reduce the large percentage of people who suffer from social problems in Peru,
                for a better future at the national level.</p>
